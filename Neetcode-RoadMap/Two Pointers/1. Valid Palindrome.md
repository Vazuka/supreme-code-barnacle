## Solutions

### Solution-1: Using String Manipulation
#### Short Description
This solution converts the input string to lowercase and removes all non-alphanumeric characters. It then checks if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n)$, where `n` is the length of the string, as it involves a single pass through the string to clean it and another pass to check if it is a palindrome.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$ due to the storage required for the cleaned string.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        if s == "": 
            return True  # An empty string is considered a palindrome

        s = s.lower()  # Convert the string to lowercase
        dum = ""  # Initialize an empty string to store alphanumeric characters

        # Iterate through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            if char.isalnum():  # Check if the character is alphanumeric
                dum += char  # Add the alphanumeric character to 'dum'
        
        if dum == "": 
            return True  # If the cleaned string is empty, it is a palindrome
        
        return dum == dum[::-1]  # Check if the cleaned string is equal to its reverse
```

### Solution-2: Two Pointers
#### Short Description
This solution uses the two-pointer technique to compare characters from the beginning and end of the string, moving towards the center. It skips non-alphanumeric characters and compares the remaining characters case-insensitively.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n)$, where `n` is the length of the string, as it involves a single pass with two pointers meeting in the middle.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(1)$, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        L, R = 0, len(s) - 1  # Initialize left and right pointers

        # Iterate until the left pointer is less than the right pointer
        while L < R:
            # Move the left pointer to the right until an alphanumeric character is found
            while L < R and not self.alnum(s[L]):
                L += 1
            # Move the right pointer to the left until an alphanumeric character is found
            while R > L and not self.alnum(s[R]):
                R -= 1
            # Compare the characters at the left and right pointers
            if s[L].lower() != s[R].lower():
                return False  # If they are not equal, the string is not a palindrome
            L += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right
            R -= 1  # Move the right pointer to the left
        
        return True  # The string is a palindrome

    def alnum(self, c):
        # Check if the character is alphanumeric using ASCII values
        return ((ord('A') <= ord(c) <= ord('Z')) or 
                (ord('a') <= ord(c) <= ord('z')) or
                (ord('0') <= ord(c) <= ord('9')))
```

## Conclusion
- The first solution is straightforward and involves converting the string and removing non-alphanumeric characters before checking if it is a palindrome.
- The second solution is more efficient in terms of space complexity and uses the two-pointer technique to compare characters directly without additional storage.
- Depending on the constraints and requirements, the second solution is generally preferable for its efficient use of space and direct comparison method.
