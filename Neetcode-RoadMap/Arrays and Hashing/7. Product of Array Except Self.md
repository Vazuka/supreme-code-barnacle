## Solutions

### Solution-1: Brute-Force
#### Short Description
This brute-force solution iterates through the array, and for each element, it calculates the product of all other elements by nesting another loop. This results in a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n^2)$ due to the nested loops.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$ for storing the result array.

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        arr = list(nums)  # Create a copy of the input array to store the result

        # Iterate through each element of the array
        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            prod = 1  # Initialize the product for the current element
            # Calculate the product of all other elements
            for j in range(0, len(arr)):
                if i != j:
                    prod = prod * nums[j]
            arr[i] = prod  # Store the product in the result array
        
        return arr
```

### Solution-2: Prefix and Postfix Product
#### Short Description
This solution uses two passes to calculate the product of all elements except the current one. In the first pass, it calculates the prefix product for each element and stores it in the result array. In the second pass, it calculates the postfix product while multiplying it with the corresponding prefix product in the result array. This way, each element in the result array contains the product of all other elements except itself.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n)$, as it requires two linear passes through the array.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(1)$, excluding the output array, as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        arr = [1] * len(nums)  # Initialize the result array with 1s

        dum = 1  # Variable for storing prefix product

        # Calculate prefix products
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            dum *= nums[i-1]  # Update the prefix product
            arr[i] = dum  # Store the prefix product in the result array

        dum = 1  # Reset the variable for postfix product

        # Calculate postfix products
        for i in range(len(nums)-2, -1, -1):
            dum *= nums[i+1]  # Update the postfix product
            arr[i] *= dum  # Multiply the postfix product with the corresponding prefix product in the result array

        return arr
```

## Conclusion
- The brute-force solution is simple but inefficient for large arrays due to its $O(n^2)$ time complexity.
- The prefix and postfix product solution is more efficient, achieving $O(n)$ time complexity with $O(1)$ extra space.
- The second solution is generally preferable for its efficiency and ability to handle larger input sizes.
