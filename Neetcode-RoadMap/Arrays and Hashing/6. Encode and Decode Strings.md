## Solutions

### Solution-1: Simple Delimiter Approach
#### Short Description
This solution uses a simple delimiter (`/`) to separate the strings in the encoded single string. During encoding, each string is concatenated with the delimiter. During decoding, the encoded string is split using the delimiter to retrieve the original list of strings. Special handling is used for empty input to avoid conflicts with the delimiter.

#### Time Complexity
- **Encoding:** The time complexity is $O(n)$, where `n` is the total number of characters in the input list. This is because each character is processed once.
- **Decoding:** The time complexity is $O(n)$ for the same reason, as splitting the string processes each character once.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$ for both encoding and decoding due to the storage of the encoded string and the list of split strings.

```python
class Solution:

    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        if strs == []: return "//\\"
        strns = ""
        for word in strs:
            strns += word + "/"
        return strns[:-1]

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        if s == "//\\": return []
        return s.split("/")
```

### Solution-2: Length Prefix Approach
#### Short Description
This solution uses a length prefix followed by a special character (`#`) to encode each string. During encoding, each string is prefixed with its length and the special character. During decoding, the length prefix and special character are used to determine the boundaries of each original string.

#### Time Complexity
- **Encoding:** The time complexity is $O(n)$, where `n` is the total number of characters in the input list. This is because each character is processed once.
- **Decoding:** The time complexity is $O(n)$, as parsing the length and extracting each string processes each character once.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$ for both encoding and decoding due to the storage of the encoded string and the list of decoded strings.

```python
class Solution:
    def encode(self, strs):
        res = ""
        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return res

    def decode(self, s):
        res = []
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while s[j] != '#':
                j += 1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            i = j + 1
            j = i + length
            res.append(s[i:j])
            i = j
            
        return res
```

## Conclusion
- The Simple Delimiter Approach is straightforward and easy to implement, but it can encounter issues if the delimiter appears in the strings themselves.
- The Length Prefix Approach is more robust, handling any character in the strings, including delimiters, by using a length prefix and a special character to mark boundaries.
- Depending on the constraints and requirements, the Length Prefix Approach is generally preferable for its robustness and ability to handle edge cases.
