## Solutions

### Solution-1: Sorting and Counting
#### Short Description
This solution sorts the array and then counts the length of consecutive sequences. It keeps track of the previous number and a count of the current sequence. If a number is not consecutive, it records the current sequence length and resets the count.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n \log n)$ due to the sorting step.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$ for storing the sequence lengths.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if nums == []: return 0
        if len(nums) == 1: return 1

        # Sort the array
        nums.sort()
        prev = nums[0]
        count = 0

        # List to store the lengths of sequences
        seq = []

        i = -1
        for n in nums:
            if (n - prev) <= 1:
                if n != prev and i != -1:
                    count += 1
                    prev = n
                elif i == -1:
                    i = 0
                    count += 1
                    prev = n
            else:  # not consecutive
                seq.append(count)
                count = 1
                prev = n
        seq.append(count)

        if seq != []:
            seq.sort(reverse=True)
            return seq[0]
        else:
            return count
```

### Solution-2: Hash Set and Linear Scan
#### Short Description
This solution uses a hash set to achieve $O(n)$ time complexity. It iterates through the array, and for each number that is the start of a sequence (i.e., `n-1` is not in the set), it counts the length of the consecutive sequence starting from that number.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is $O(n)$ because each element is processed a constant number of times.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$ for storing the elements in a hash set.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)  # Create a set of numbers for O(1) lookups
        longest = 0  # Variable to store the length of the longest sequence

        for n in nums:
            # Check if 'n' is the start of a sequence
            if (n - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 0
                # Count the length of the consecutive sequence starting from 'n'
                while (n + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)  # Update the longest sequence length
        return longest
```

## Conclusion
- The first solution sorts the array and counts the length of consecutive sequences. It is straightforward but less efficient due to its $O(n \log n)$ time complexity.
- The second solution uses a hash set for $O(1)$ lookups and achieves $O(n)$ time complexity, making it more efficient for large inputs.
- Depending on the constraints and requirements, the hash set solution is generally preferable for its linear time complexity and efficient handling of large datasets.
