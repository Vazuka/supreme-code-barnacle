## Solutions

### Solution-1: Brute Force
#### Short Description
This solution uses a nested loop to iterate through the list and check every possible pair of indices to find the two numbers that add up to the target. For each element, it calculates the difference between the target and the element and then searches for that difference in the remaining part of the array.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is $O(n^2)$, where `n` is the length of the list. This is because we have to check each pair of elements.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(1)$, as no extra space is required other than the input list and a few variables.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)
        for i in range(0, length):
            diff = target - nums[i]
            for j in range(i+1, length):
                if nums[j] == diff:
                    return [i, j]
```

### Solution-2: Using Dictionary (HashMap)
#### Short Description
This solution uses a dictionary to store the indices of the elements as we iterate through the list. For each element, it calculates the difference between the target and the element. If this difference is already in the dictionary, it means we have found the pair of indices. If not, it adds the element and its index to the dictionary.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$, where `n` is the length of the list. This is because we iterate through the list only once.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n)$, since the dictionary will store up to `n` elements in the worst case.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)
        num_map = {}
        for i in range(0, length):
            diff = target - nums[i]
            if diff in num_map:  # check if the required number is already in the dictionary
                return [num_map[diff], i]
            num_map[nums[i]] = i  # add new number to dictionary
```

## Conclusion
- The brute force solution is straightforward but inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic time complexity.
- The dictionary-based solution is much more efficient, achieving linear time complexity by using extra space for the dictionary.
- Depending on the constraints and requirements, the dictionary-based solution is generally preferable due to its better performance.
