## Solutions

### Solution-1: Brute Force
#### Short Description
This solution uses a brute force approach to group anagrams. It iterates over the list of strings, checking each string against the rest to see if they are anagrams using a helper function `isAnagram`. If they are, it groups them together and removes the anagram from the list to avoid duplicate checks.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is $O(n^2 \cdot m \log m)$, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the maximum length of a string. This is because for each string, it compares with every other string and checks if they are anagrams by sorting.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n \cdot m)$ due to the space required to store the grouped anagrams.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        outer = []

        i = 0
        while i < len(strs):
            sub = [strs[i]]
            j = i+1
            remove_indices = []
            while j < len(strs):
                if self.isAnagram(strs[i], strs[j]):
                    sub.append(strs[j])
                    remove_indices.append(j)
                j += 1
            
            for index in sorted(remove_indices, reverse=True):
                strs.pop(index)
            
            outer.append(sub)
            i += 1

        return outer

    def isAnagram(self, source: str, target: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(source) == sorted(target)
```
- **Note**: The brute force solution is **not** accepted by LeetCode as it is too slow!

### Solution-2: Using ASCII Values
#### Short Description
This solution uses a hash map (dictionary) to group anagrams. It creates a key based on the frequency of each character in a word, represented as a tuple of counts for each letter in the alphabet. It then groups words with the same character frequency together.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is $O(n \cdot m)$, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the maximum length of a string. This is because we iterate through each character of each string to calculate the frequency counts.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n \cdot m)$ due to the space required to store the frequency counts and the grouped anagrams.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        outer = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for word in strs:
            arr = [0] * 26
            for s in word:
                arr[ord(s) - ord('a')] += 1
            outer[tuple(arr)].append(word)
        return outer.values()
```

### Solution-3: Using Sorting
#### Short Description
This solution sorts each string to form a key and uses a dictionary to group strings with the same sorted key together. If two strings are anagrams, their sorted versions will be identical.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is $O(n \cdot m \log m)$, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the maximum length of a string. This is due to the sorting operation for each string.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is $O(n \cdot m)$ due to the space required to store the sorted strings and the grouped anagrams.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        """
        Here, we declare a `defaultdict` with `list` as the 'default factory function'. This means that if
        a key is not found in the dictionary, it will create an entry with the key and an empty list as its value.
        """
        anagrams = defaultdict(list)

        for word in strs:
            anagrams[''.join(sorted(word))].append(word)

        return list(anagrams.values())
```

## Conclusion
- The brute force solution is straightforward but inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic time complexity.
- The ASCII values solution is efficient with linear time complexity, using extra space for the dictionary to store frequency counts.
- The sorting-based solution is also effective, leveraging the properties of sorted strings to group anagrams, but has a higher time complexity due to sorting.
- Depending on the constraints and requirements, the ASCII values solution is generally preferable for its linear time complexity.
